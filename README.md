Couldn't upload 'node_modules' folder. Add it into your proj dir yourself.

index.html is obviously the HTML (all my CSS is inline cos honestly until i make UI, most of the elements are from mapbox lol)

server.js uses express (so port 3000)

markers.json is the array where script.js pushes CO-ORDS, TITLES, and DESCRIPTIONS
